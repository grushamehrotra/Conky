# Conky

I customized some conky scripts according to my needs and as per my liking.<br> 
<br> The original conky scripts/themes are called Gotham and CoolCube.<br>
<br> NOTE: I did not want the graphical boxes from CoolCube to display so I commented that part of the code. Un-comment line #53-#58 in conkyrc if you need them to display on your desktop and change the alignment of the text that you want to display inside the boxes accordingly. I have also included the graphix.lua script needed for their execution.
